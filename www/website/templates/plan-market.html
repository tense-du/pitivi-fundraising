                  a "proxy" version that is more suited for editing, and then using
                  the original, full-quality clip to do the render. This is useful
                  when working with input formats that are not efficient/fast enough for
                  live editing or when dealing with high definition/computationally
                  expensive footage for which the computer is not powerful enough
                  to handle realtime playback. This is also
                  something <a href="http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/Proxy_editing_requirements">that has already been tackled</a>
                  but that still needs quite a bit of work to reach the necessary level of maturity.
