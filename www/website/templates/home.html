        Mathieu Duponchelle, Pitivi developer since 2010 is the one who started, the port to the
        <a href="gstreamer-editing-services">GStreamer Editing Services</a> 
        during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code">Google summer of code </a>
        (GSoC) 2011.  This work was achieved under Thibault Saunier mentoring. He has been since then
        very involved in the Pitivi project and is now a core member of the Pitivi community.

       <!--Would be great to get some positive opinion to link to here!-->
      <p class="indent" align="justify">
        In 2013, he worked again as a GSoC student, this time in order to bring the port of Pitivi to GES to a releasable and usable state. Thanks to his
        hard work and his close collaboration with the GStreamer community, he fixed a ton of bugs in all the components of Pitivi and
        became a very active member of the GStreamer project as a whole.

      <p class="indent" align="justify">
        Thibault Saunier joined the PiTiVi project as a Summer of
        Code student in 2010 and has been hooked ever since. He has been
        the main developer of the GStreamer Editing Services since 2011,
        and has been implementing all the feature that were needed by
        Pitivi but were not yet implemented at the time of the porting.
        He has been investing a massive amount of his free time making sure
        that Pitivi was going in the right direction and making sure the
        GStreamer Editing Services were the solid basis Pitivi needs to
        fully leverage the power of GStreamer.
